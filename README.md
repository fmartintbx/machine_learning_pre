Data preprocessing plays a crucial role in machine learning workflows. It involves transforming raw data into a suitable format that can be effectively utilized by machine learning algorithms. By carefully preprocessing the data, we can enhance its quality, remove inconsistencies, handle missing values, and normalize the features, ultimately improving the performance and reliability of our models.
